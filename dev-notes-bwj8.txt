Test out the concept of the player ship having energy gems follow behind with a little lag.
Energy gems result after a satellite piece has been obliterated.

DONE * Create Room with space background
DONE * Create Ship sprite and object
DONE * Create Energy gem sprite and object
DONE * Give Ship controls so it can fly around
** Thrust, rotate CW, rotate CCW
DONE * Position ship and gems in room

TODO * Change ship thrust and direction so image_angle and direction of movement are unhinged.
TODO * Have ship check circle for collisions with gems
TODO * Tell collided gems they are now being sucked in, so they can just have this STATE behavior in their Step event therafter.
TODO * Possibly prioritize collided gems in order from closest to furthest, so each gem knows which gem is their parent they are supposed to get behind.
TODO * Make viewport / camera follow player
