Test out the concept of the player ship having energy gems follow behind with a little lag.
Energy gems result after a satellite piece has been obliterated.

DONE * Create Room with space background
DONE * Create Ship sprite and object
DONE * Create Energy gem sprite and object
DONE * Give Ship controls so it can fly around
** Thrust, rotate CW, rotate CCW
DONE * Position ship and gems in room
DONE * Change ship thrust and direction so image_angle and direction of movement are unhinged.
DONE * Make viewport / camera follow player

=========================
DONE * Make some satellite sprites and objects
DONE * Give satellites a parent
DONE * Put all satellites in room
DONE * Make satellites rotate
DONE * Change room size
1366 x 768 and now double that
2732 x 1536
** Some same-ratios:
683 x 384

WAIT * Make satellite pieces
* First level of satellite being blasted by ship
* This will probably be just one object, and the satellite will spawn the object with appropriate sprite whenever satellite is destroyed.

TODO * Make player ship wrap
* Event is in there, but doesn't seem to wrap??

TODO * Make satellites wrap at edge of Room


================================
== Later
================================
* Consider making center of satellite sprites off a bit, so they rotate in a funny way suggesting they are decrepit.


TODO * Have ship check circle for collisions with gems
** Make list of the collided gems in the circle
collision_circle_list(x1, y1, rad, obj, prec, notme, list, ordered);

TODO * Tell collided gems they are now being sucked in, so they can just have this STATE behavior in their Step event therafter.
BOOL is_captured
or
STATE captured, free, recycling, evil

TODO * Possibly prioritize collided gems in order from closest to furthest, so each gem knows which gem is their parent they are supposed to get behind.
** list belonging to player, of captured gems.
** captured_gems[] has their id's
** each gem has ID of the object it is supposed to be following
