Test out the concept of the player ship having energy gems follow behind with a little lag.
Energy gems result after a satellite piece has been obliterated.

DONE * Create Room with space background
Create Ship sprite and object
Create Energy gem sprite and object
Give Ship controls so it can fly around
Position ship and gems in room
Have ship check circle for collisions with gems
Tell collided gems they are now being sucked in, so they can just have this STATE behavior in their Step event therafter.
Possibly prioritize collided gems in order from closest to furthest, so each gem knows which gem is their parent they are supposed to get behind.
